# Clean/Good code?

# why Asynchronous code

- Javascript model
- While you're waiting, you might be able to do something else
- Non blocking

What are you doing? Asking the code to do something for you, and to let you know when they've finished. Your main code path is giving orders to subpaths. 

A manager might ask an employee to look something up.
# Callbacks

The employee will report to the boss in person

# Deferreds / Promises

The employee will write the report down and give it to the boss

# Promise chaining

The manager hands the report to his senior

# Error handling

The manager might fix any problems the employee is having, or defer this his senior

# Generators

The manager and employee are in constant communication about the problem

# Await

The manager wait until the employee has finished without doing anything else

# Review clean/good code guidelines
